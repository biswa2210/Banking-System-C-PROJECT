## About :point_down: 

<div align="justified">
 
A student information system (SIS), student management system, school administration software or student administration system is a management information system for education establishments used to manage student data. Student information systems provide capabilities for registering students in courses; documenting grading, transcripts of academic achievement and co-curricular activities, and the results of student assessment scores; forming student schedules; tracking student attendance; and managing other student-related data needs in an educational institution. Information security is a concern, as universities house an array of sensitive personal information, making them potentially attractive targets for security breaches, such as those experienced by retail corporations or healthcare providers. Student management system is an environment where all the process of the student in the institution is managed. It is done through the automated computerized method. Conventionally this system is done using papers, file and binders. This system saves the time of the student and of the administrator. It includes process like registration of the student’s details, assigning the department based on their course and maintenance of the record. This system reduces the cost and workforce required for this job. As the system is online the information is globally present to everyone. This makes the system easy to handle and feasible for finding the omission with updating at the same time. As for the existing system, they use to maintain their record manually which makes it vulnerable to security. If filed a query to search or update in a manual system, it will take a lot of time to process the query and make a report which is a tedious job. As the system used in the institute is outdated as it requires paper, files and the binders, which will require the human workforce to maintain them. To get registered in the institute, a student in this system one should come to the university. Get the forms from the counter while standing in the queue which consumes a lot of the student’s time as well as of management team. As the number of the student increases in the institute manually managing the strength becomes a hectic job for the administrator. This computerized system store all the data in the database which makes it easy to fetch and update whenever needed.

## The Records Consist :point_down:

 - ADD STUDENT<br>
 - SHOW ALL STUDENTS<br>
 - FIND STUDENT<br>
 - DELETE STUDENT<br>
 - EXIT<br>

## Purpose :point_down:

<div align="justified">

It describes aspects of the system that are concerned with how the system provides the functional requirements. They are:
a.	Security: <br>
The subsystem should provide a high level of security and integrity of the data held by the system, only authorized personnel of the system can gain access to the system’s secured page on the system. <br>
b.	Performance and Response Time: <br>
The system should have high performance rate when executing user’s input and should be able to provide the response within a short time span usually seconds for highly complicated task and 20 to 25 seconds for less complicated task. <br>
c.	Error handling: <br>
Error should be considerably minimized and an appropriate error message that guides the user to recover from an error should be provided. Validation of user’s input is highly essential. Also the standard time taken to recover from an error should be 15 to 20 seconds. <br>
d.	Availability:  <br>
This system should always be available for access at 24 hours, 7 days a week. Also in the occurrence of any major system malfunctioning, the system should be available in 1 to 2 working days, so that the business process is not severely affected. <br>
e.	Ease of use: <br>
Considered the level of knowledge possessed by the user of this system, a simple but quality user interface should be developed to make it easy to understand and required less training.  <br>
</div>

## Use :point_down:

<div align="justified">
 
Here we can choose option.
a.	Adding Students:  <br>
All the required students’ details containing their name, roll number, enrolment number, registration number, phone number, city are added when we choose option 1 in menu. <br>
b.	Displaying Whole Record: <br>
All the added records are stored in a database and are fetched and showed when we choose option 3 in menu. <br>
c.	Searching Particular Customer Information: <br>
We can choose option 4 when we want to search a particular student’s record. We have to give the enrolment number of that student to get that student’s details. <br>
d.	Deleting Records: <br>
When we want to delete a student’s record we have to choose option 2 and give that student’s id no. Then that record will be deleted. <br>
e.	Exit Program: <br>
If we want to exit the program we have to choose option 5. Then the program will be closed. <br>
We have used Idea Intellij Software for java. <br>

## Applications :point_down:

<div align="justified">
 
1. Improves the General Performance Of Students <br>
For students to come out with good grades, the focus is highly needed. With this school administration software, students are able to use their precious time for relevant things which is studying rather than keep track of their records to make sure things are intact. Moreover, fear of losing important records to manual management is completely off the line with the help of this software. <br>
2. It helps Simply and Streamlines All Task <br>
As a teacher, keeping track of all the activities done by each student is never easy and inefficient. But with this student record system, teachers are able to keep track of each student work and what is yet to be done. In most software, there is a dashboard and a single screen display to make things even easier and more efficient.
3. Improved Communication <br>
It's impossible for every student in a class to get each lesson passed across while teaching. This might be a problem on the path of the students being timid or reluctant at that point in time or insufficient time to ask questions. With the help of this software, that has been sorted out. Most online school management software now has an inbuilt discussion panel where students could easily communicate with their teachers and ask relevant questions. <br>
4. Can Be Accessed by All Parties Involved <br>
Gone are the days when parents know little to nothing about what their child or ward does at school. This open source school management system has made it possible for parents to have access to their children's school activities, assignments, attendance, and other relevant information just by using the software. <br>
5. Efficient Management And Organization of Timetables <br>
The management of a school timetable is the work of the admin department of a school. Despite being dedicated to a department, it never correlates. With this software, the reverse is the case. This student record system is able to organize school timetables in such a way that they won't be a clash of lectures. In addition to that, students, teachers, and parents have access to it. <br>
6. Helps to Keep Track Of All Students <br>
School activity goes beyond the wall of the classrooms. There are other activities like sports, interaction, and other extracurricular activities and all these needs proper documentation. This management software has features that see to that and make sure the record of each student is intact. <br>
7. Reduction of Human Labour, Papers and Workload <br>
The cost incurred from employing staff to manage the activities of a school is an additional cost that shouldn't be if you decide to make use of this new technology. With this student management system, your number of staffs, excessive buying of writing materials will be minimal and functionality will improve. <br>
8. Provide A Means to Advice Students <br>
The student management system has an advising module that helps facilitate student advising process. This is most effective when a particular student is having a draw down academically and advice is to be given by teachers. <br>
9. Helps Build A Strong Alumni <br>
There is more to life than the walls of the school. This same software has the ability to build an alumni network to help other students with job referrals. All this is made possible with the help of this software. <br>
10. Improves the General Comfort Of Staffs <br>
Work comfort is another factor that determines the performance of staff and this student management system have successfully put that in place. Teachers are able to manage their students in a smart way. <br>
 </div>

## Future Scopes :point_down:

<div align="justified">
 
1.This student record system can be deployed in a online web portal for students and teachers. <br>
2. One can upgrade this web portal to store subject video lectures under different professor names and also maintain the previous year’s question papers in it. <br>
3.The portal can be used to take day to day attendance and automatically send an SMS to the students and their parent. <br>
4. One can deploy this web application into mobile android application and be used in smaller devices like mobile phones, tablets and notepads. <br>
5. In future web portal can be combined with the university internal and external web sites. So that all courses in the university will have single web app. <br>
6. Students can directly fill a resume forum system will use artificial intelligence and sent the resume to companies as per student requirement and eligibility criteria. <br>
7. The present system may be further upgraded in future even maintain the activities in hostel like hostel mess bill and attendance system even in hostels. <br>
8. By using artificial intelligence the web portal may track the usage of Wi – Fi based on the students registered device. <br>
